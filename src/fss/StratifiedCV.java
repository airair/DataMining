/***************************************************************************
  StratifiedCV divides the training set into separate sets based on the 
label of each instance.  Cross Validation is then performed, taking 
instances from each small list in turn.  The overall process is similar to 
that used with CrossValidator. Assumes that the order and contents of the 
training list returned by the inducer is the same as the order and 
contents of the training list passed to the inducer. The training list may 
be altered by the inducer during training, but it must be returned to the 
same state.

  Complexity   : estimate_performance() takes O(numTimes*numFolds*
                   O(train_and_test()).
		 auto_estimate() takes O(estimate_performance() * number
		   of iterations).  Number of iterations is bounded
		   by Log_2(numFolds).
  Enhancements : Keep the relative order of instances intact.  This
		    seems to be hard if the inducer is allowed to
		    modify its training set (e.g. when it does cross
		    validation) since references to the list will change.
		 When a fraction of training set is specified, keep the
		    fraction stratified.  Currently, the fraction is
		    just a straight (random) fraction of the training
		    set.
