/** The RealAttributeColumn class provides a array representation for a real
 * column (real attribute, label and weight).  The array representation has
 * better data locality than a doubly linked instance list and thus is more
 * efficient for discretization. RealAttributeColumn includes the AttrInfo for
 * the real attribute and the label.  However, these are const references,
 * therefore whoever owns these AttrInfos must not delete them until the
 * RealAttribueColumn referring to them has been deleted.			<P>
 *
 * The size of the data array must not exceed that given in the constructor.
 * Because the class is used for transforming already existing instance lists
 * (see InstanceList.transpose), the maximum size can be estimated well enough
 * in advance.											<P>
 * Zero-weight instances added to the column are disregarded. Since an
 * instance with zero weight is equivalent to no instances, such instances
 * should be disregarded by tasks that use the RealAndLabelColumn (like
 * discretization and the like).
